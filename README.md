# framework7-react
This project is an example of Framework 7, React, Redux and Webpack.
This example is taken from one of the demo apps from Framework7, but using Redux and webpack.


## About

### Framework7
A mobile framework in HTML to build hybrid apps or webapps with a native look and feel. It is designed for iOS and Android. 
### React
React is by Facebook and is actively supported by them. It is a javascript library to build user interface, using ES2015.
### Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. 
### webpack
A modular bundler for Javascript applications, making it easy to handle dependencies

## Running the project
It is as easy as spinning up a webserver and launching the index.html page. It is using webpack, where the src is in the 'src' folder and output to the 'script' folder. Running 'webpack -w' would bundle the files in the src folder and produce the bundle.js. Index.html refers to bundle.js.
